A fascinatingly chipper [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticon]] who seems practically attached at the hip to his dear [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Spark Bond\|amica]], [[Characters/Darkwing\|Darkwing]]. Dreadwind’s never seen without a smile, and no matter how dire things look, he’s always confident that things will turn out just fine. Oddly enough, he tends to be right more often than not.

He’s always seen the best in everyone, from the perpetually down-in-the-dumps [[Vortex\|Vortex]] to someone who seemed [[Characters/Hi-Test\|determined to do nothing but waste his potential]]. 
#### Notes

- Dreadwind and Darkwing are [Those Two Guys](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys). They are Mirror Mirror’s Blue Beetle and Booster Gold.
