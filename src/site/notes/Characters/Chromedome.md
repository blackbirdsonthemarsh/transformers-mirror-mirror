Chromedome is a private detective with perhaps the strangest luck on Cybertron. He’d find himself hired for something utterly mundane, perhaps even mind-numbingly so. An affair, perhaps, or a missing person that the enforcers just couldn’t catch the trail of. Without fail, such a case would spiral wildly out of control, leading to a half-dozen other mysteries and perhaps even a conspiracy or two being uncovered along the way. 

It was during one such case that he met the [[Characters/Prowl\|‘bot]] that would change the course of his life forever. A private investigator with a motormouth and a sense of justice that bordered on suicidal. Everywhere Chromedome went, there was that chatterbox, talking to the same witnesses, poking around the same places, and even taking note of the same clues!

Their cases couldn’t be any more different! Or, so Chromedome thought… but much to his chagrin (and Prowl’s amusement) their cases were, in fact, the very same. They’d only been approaching them from different angles. Putting his pride — and his disdain for what might be the strangest ‘bot in [[Cybertron/Polities/Praxus\|Praxus]] — aside, Chromedome reached out to this Prowl fellow, offering to collaborate. 

Their partnership was far from idyllic— it was for convenience’s sake, nothing more. They respected each other, needed each other, but they certainly didn’t like each other. Chromedome found Prowl’s more off-the-wall tendencies grating, and Prowl considered Chromedome to be a stick-in-the-mud who’d die before he ever thought outside the box. 

As one mystery began to multiply, and the stakes began to rise far higher than either could have anticipated… they came to tolerate one another, perhaps even like each other. By the time Chromedome was handing his findings in to his long-suffering client, and Prowl was putting together his report, the two could even call each other friends. Chromedome had to admit, Prowl had his charms— and he could even be endearing, at the right moment. 

One begrudging collaboration led to a second, and then a third, and then the two were regular associates— and surprisingly close friends. 

Even when their cases didn’t overlap, they found ways to work together. Prowl would pitch in to help Chromedome on his investigations, using his connections to help Chromedome get information he couldn’t otherwise access, and Chromedome used his skills as a detective to assist Prowl with his investigations, and would often go to Prowl with his own findings, so he could bring them to light.

In many ways, Prowl made Chromedome a better person. Prowl’s unshakable moral compass and seemingly unstoppable determination to drag the ills of their society out into the light for all to see rubbed off on Chromedome, whose profession had left him quite jaded. Prowl’s determination to drag him out of his office at least once a month got Chromedome, as Prowl would say, “living a little.” Though, he would always find Prowl’s wackier tendencies to be headache-inducing, and the two tended to bicker quite a bit when it came to the more… conspiratorial things Prowl tended to believe. Oh, yes, the [[Institute\|government]] is [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Shadowplay\|brainwashing]] people– very funny, Prowl.

He will, to this day, never admit how often Prowl’s “wild theories” as he called them turned out to be right. He’ll always maintain that he was the more strait-laced of the two, where Prowl always tended to have his head in the clouds.

Eventually, the two stumbled into a relationship, though Prowl will tell you that most of the stumbling was on Chromedome’s end. Chromedome fell first, though he barely noticed he had– and it took him an embarrassingly long time to realize that no, Prowl covering his desk in flowers and home-made energon goodies (that he had learned to make just for Chromedome) was not, in fact, Prowl’s way of saying that they were great friends.

As time went on, and the political situation on Cybertron began to [[Characters/Sentinel Prime\|deteriorate]], Prowl began investigating the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Primacy\|wrong]] [[Senate\|people]]. When a colleague and on-again, off-again [[Tarantulas\|lover]] of his disappeared under mysterious circumstances, Chromedome and Rewind began to fear for their friend’s safety… and Rewind began to wonder if those [[Institute\|nonsensical]] [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Shadowplay\|theories]] of his had some truth to them after all. 

In the wake of the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Decepticon Uprising\|Decepticon Uprising]] and the fall of the Primacy, most assumed that the worst was over. Prowl, on the other hand, saw which way the [[The Great War/Factions/Autobots/Autobot\|wind was blowing]] long before the rest of the planet. He begged Chromedome and Rewind to leave Cybertron, to go to [[Paradron\|Paradron]], Velocitron, _anywhere._ Prowl, however, insisted that he would stay… he couldn’t sit by and watch, he said. When the war began in earnest, when news of the brutality made its way to the Cybertronian diaspora… all Chromedome could think of was Prowl.

Why did he stay? Why did Chromedome _let_ him stay? Why didn’t he say anything, why didn’t he beg him to come with them? As the news became worse and worse, as their correspondence with Prowl became less and less frequent, Chromedome felt worse and worse. Damn Prowl’s conscience, damn his morals, damn his need to always stick his neck out!

And then came the day when Prowl stopped responding. 

Life went on for Chromedome and Rewind. They made a new life on Paradron. Rewind settled into a position as an archivist in the city they’d moved to, and Chromedome found work as a data analyst. Years turned into centuries, centuries turned into millennia, so on and so forth… and the war became little more than background noise. Despite this… Chromedome kept thinking of Prowl. He and Rewind would check their messages every week, in the vain hope that he would have responded, have said something, anything to indicate that he was alive…

Nothing.

They only learned Prowl was alive when they returned to Cybertron after the end of the war. Finding out just why Prowl had ceased all communications, had very nearly let them believe he was dead… Chromedome could hardly look him in the eye.

Chromedome had been happy, had been safe, for all these millions of years. Prowl, every second of every day, had been in danger. One mistake would have cost him his life. Simple bad luck would have cost him his life. Like he always had, he threw himself into danger for the greater good… and this time, Chromedome wasn’t by his side.
##### Notes
---
- Instead of being haunted by his past actions, Chromedome is haunted by past inaction. Rather than erase his grief, he’s the type to wallow in it, never giving himself permission to just move on. 
- Instead of being a police officer, Chromedome is a private detective of the [hard-boiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardboiled) variety. Initially, I made the decision just to make him fit better with Prowl, who’s an Ida Tarbell or Upton Sinclair type, but I decided to lean into it, and pack Chromedome’s character full of homages to one of my favorite genres. Of course, instead of a fiery dame, he gets a grumpy archivist. Well, there is Prowl…
- Chromedome’s colors are a rather flattering monochrome, as a nod to old noir detective films.
- Instead of being eager to believe all those conspiracy theories about the Institute, Mirror Mirror Chromedome is a natural skeptic… even when he really, really shouldn’t be.
