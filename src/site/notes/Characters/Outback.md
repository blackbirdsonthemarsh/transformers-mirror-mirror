Some ‘bots aspire towards [[Characters/Optimus Prime\|something greater]], some feel they have a destiny. Not Outback— he’s never had the patience for anything even resembling a higher calling, and he’s quite happy to go about his day as a relatively insignificant ‘bot, utterly and wonderfully unremarkable. Sure, a job at the dockyards in [[Polities of Cybertron/Kalis\|Kalis]] is hardly glamorous, but he loves what he does anyhow— and he wouldn’t trade it for anything. 
##### Notes
---
- Imagine being born a poor kid in a portside city, and growing up with a pair of friends who you were practically attached to at the hip. Imagine growing up, finding a job, and settling into a life that, while not glamorous, makes you happy. Your job is hard, but it’s fulfilling, and you truly love what you do every day. Imagine losing contact with those friends of yours when a war breaks out, and thinking the worst. Then imagine finding out that your friends became utterly deranged dictators who hate the working class, but still consider you their closest pal, and really want to go on a fishing trip after all this business with conquering the planet is over with. This is what Outback is going through.
