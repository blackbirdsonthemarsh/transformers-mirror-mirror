Few would expect an aircraft carrier to be the delicate, gentle sort, but Tidal Wave is a hundred thousand tons of sweetness and light, and is remarkably soft-spoken for a someone over a thousand feet tall. If not for his impressive size and firepower, Tidal Wave would be quite the wallflower, and even he admits that he’d hardly talk to anyone if he didn’t have ‘bots stationed aboard him. Despite the veritable hornet’s nest he carries inside him, he’s prone to worry, even though he and his crew are the most terrifying thing in the [[Cybertron/Locations/Mithril Sea\|Mithril Sea]]. 

While he’s a proud [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticon]] and a loyal soldier, Tidal Wave longs for peace, and most of all, he longs for a day he can retire. 
##### Notes
---
- Tidal Wave is roughly the size of the [USS Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gerald_R._Ford), the largest aircraft carrier in the world as of 2025. 
- Like most boats in Mirror Mirror, he spends the majority of his time in vehicle mode, and he regards it as his default state. 
- Characters who have served aboard him include: [[Characters/Lyzack\|Lyzack]], [[Leozack\|Leozack]], [[Characters/Thunderclash\|Thunderclash]], [[Dirge\|Dirge]], [[Ramjet\|Ramjet]], [[Thrust\|Thrust]], [[Cloudcover\|Cloudcover]], [[Nightflight\|Nightflight]], [[Gaihawk\|Gaihawk]], [[Hellbat\|Hellbat]], [[Windsweeper\|Windsweeper]], [[Shatter\|Shatter]], [[Lunaclub\|Lunaclub]] and [[Moonheart\|Moonheart]]. 
- Lyzack is one of his closest friends, and she loves to perch on his conning tower to watch the stars with him. After the war, she visits him every day, and they frequently take trips across the sea.
