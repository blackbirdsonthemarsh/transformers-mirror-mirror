Krok bears the honor of being one of the earliest [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticon]] to have followed [[Characters/Megatron\|Megatron]], and has served with distinction. Krok’s attitude belies his age, and his tendency to keep others at arm’s length doesn’t endear him to many. Brilliant though he may be, his aloofness has proved quite the stumbling block for those under his command. Though, his walls have come down for [[Characters/Spinister\|more]] [[Bludgeon\|than]] [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Mayhem\|a]] [[Characters/Fulcrum\|few]] [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Scavengers\|‘bots]], proving there is something of a spark in there after all. 

His [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Outlier\|outlier]] abilities don’t make him any less intimidating. With a single step, he can create an earthquake with a reading of 7.0 on the Richter scale, and with a well-placed kick, he can launch a ‘bot into orbit. 

Though he’s always been the aloof sort, as his [[Characters/Twirl\|batchmates]] will attest, Krok wasn’t always so cold.

Krok was built as part of an experimental line of stealth bombers [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Reproduction\|constructed cold]] in [[Cybertron/Polities of Cybertron/Polyhex\|Polyhex]]. On account of his [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Outlier\|unusual spark]], he

- Like many characters in Mirror Mirror, a good bit of Krok’s character comes not from any actual story, but from extraneous materials like bios and tech specs. Krok’s outlier abilities come from his [Dreamwave](https://64.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma5jdgnEYD1qg5jqjo2_1280.jpg), [Wings Universe](http://transformersclub.com/Timelines9_2014.pdf) and G1 bios, and his alternate mode comes from his [Timelines](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Krok_(G1)#Timelines) figure. His tendency to talk to his pet similarly comes from his Wings Universe incarnation. 
- The ability of Krok and his line to be able to sleep mid-flight is a nod to the B-2 Spirit’s extensive flight systems, which are constantly making all sorts of miniscule adjustments to keep it in the air. On account of Cybertronian aircraft essentially being fly-by-wire systems given sentience, I decided to interpret the B-2’s particular quirks as a highly advanced autopilot system that lets him take mid-flight naps. 
- His line is titled the AM-90, which is a nod to Krok being an Action Master released in the year 1990. 
- His deep friendship with Bludgeon is a nod to his role as the ‘bot’s advisor in Marvel G1 (and its subsequent continuations) and the story of how they met was inspired by his backstory in IDW.
