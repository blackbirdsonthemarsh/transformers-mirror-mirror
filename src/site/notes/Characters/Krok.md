Krok bears the honor of being one of the earliest [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticons\|Decepticons]] to have followed [[Characters/Megatron\|Megatron]], and has served with distinction.  Krok’s attitude belies his age, though his walls have come down for [[Characters/Spinister\|more]] [[Bludgeon\|than]] [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Mayhem\|a]] [[Characters/Fulcrum\|few]] [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Scavengers\|‘bots]], proving there is something of a spark underneath all that armor.
