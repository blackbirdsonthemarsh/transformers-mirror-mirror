One of the founders of the [[The Great War/Factions/Autobots/Autobots\|Autobots]] alongside her [[Lore/History, Society and Culture/Spark Bonds\|conjunx]], [[Characters/Optimus Prime\|Optimus Prime]], and his brother, [[Characters/Ultra Magnus\|Ultra Magnus]]. She went on to found and lead the [[Furies\|Furies]], an elite Autobot strike force. 

In the final days of the [[The Great War/The Great War\|Cybertronian civil war]], after being forced from power in the wake of her conjunx's death, Elita clung to the few allies she had as the faction she had worked so hard to build crumbled around her. When even they deserted her, she finally came to realize that all hope was lost. In a final act of petty spite, she murdered [[Characters/Rodimus Prime\|Rodimus Prime]], before partaking in one last battle, where she was killed by [[Characters/Starscream\|Starscream]].
