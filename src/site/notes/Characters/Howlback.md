- Much like [[Characters/Soundwave\|Soundwave]], [[Characters/Rewind\|Rewind]] and [[Characters/Flip Sides\|the]] [[Characters/Ravage\|other]] [[Characters/Frenzy\|micro-]][[Characters/Rumble\|cassettes]], Howlbackâ€™s canonical alternate mode would be utterly impossible for Mirror Mirror. There was fortunately a natural alternative in the form of the [NASA X-43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_X-43), an unmanned hypersonic aircraft deployed from another, much larger aircraft.
