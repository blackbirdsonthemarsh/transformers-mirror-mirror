##### Notes
---
- Sentinel and Zeta contrast each other the most out of the three interwar Primes (Nominus, who is a mix between Guardian Prime from G1 and Nominus from IDW, Zeta, and Sentinel). All of them were deeply paranoid war veterans who let their experiences during the Quintesson war define them, but Zeta’s time was remembered as an era of stagnation, of careful, slow policy changes that moved ever-so-incrementally. Zeta preferred coalition-building, and relied heavily upon a core body of leaders (all his former comrades from the war). Sentinel’s reign, on the other hand, was characterized by rapid change— one that many came to remember as taking an axe to every other government program. Where Zeta put on a pretty face, Sentinel was all about naked force— he didn’t _care_ to put a mask on it, to act like he didn’t have complete control. Zeta cared a lot about public image (unlike his canon self in the comics, who only started out that way and descended wholeheartedly into cackling villainy by the end of the Autocracy and Primacy series) and is seen in a far better light than his successor (which is… not saying much!) whereas Sentinel’s reign just exposed the soulless authoritarianism of the Primacy, and began to radicalize vast swathes of Cybertron against not just him, but the government as a whole.
