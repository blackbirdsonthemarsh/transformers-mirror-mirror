Some ‘bots are natural wallflowers, preferring to spend their time with houseplants and pets than other people. Some ‘bots would rather climb straight into the jaws of a [[Trans-Organic\|Trans-Organic]] than be the center of attention. 

Airachnid is not one of those ‘bots. 

When she steps into a room, all eyes are on her. Airachnid is bombastic, energetic, with a love for life that persists [[The Great War/Great War\|no matter the circumstances]]. Ever the social butterfly, Airachnid is the first to step up and welcome a newcomer, and has quite the knack for making friends, no matter how [[Characters/Starscream\|reserved]] or how [[Characters/Shockwave\|prickly]] someone may be. As a commander, she’s earned the loyalty of her troops a thousand times over, and she cares for them all in turn.  
##### Notes
---
- Where her original incarnation adopted an [RAH-66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing%E2%80%93Sikorsky_RAH-66_Comanche) as her Earth disguise, Mirror Mirror Airachnid transforms into the Cybertronian equivalent of the [AH-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_AH-64_Apache) which was chosen to reflect her character. Where her Prime counterpart wildly overestimates her abilities and the respect she gets from others, and tends to forget that she’s rather underwhelming compared to the rest of the Decepticons, Mirror Mirror Airachnid is tough as nails and she _knows_ it. 
- The best way to describe Mirror Mirror Airachnid is “what if a Devil May Cry protagonist was an AH-64 attack helicopter?” 
- Much like with [[Characters/Shockwave\|Shockwave]], while I have nothing against typical depictions of Shattered Glass Airachnid, I decided to go a different direction. 
- Airachnid is a devoted fan of a long-running sitcom produced in her homeland of [[Helex\|Helex]]. It has existed longer than sharks, only took a break because of the war, and production picked back up the day the ceasefire was declared. The first episode of the new season aired a week after peace was declared. Another show she’s a fan of never bothered to stop in the first place.
