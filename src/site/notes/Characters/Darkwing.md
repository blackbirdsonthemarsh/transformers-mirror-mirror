A [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticon]] rarely seen without either his [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Spark Bond\|amica]], [[Characters/Dreadwind\|Dreadwind]], or his [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Spark Bond\|binary-bonded]] partner,  [[Characters/Throttle\|Throttle]].  Darkwing’s something of a nihilist, believing that there is no higher meaning in the universe… so it’s up to each and every one of us to create our own meaning. To that end, he wholeheartedly throws himself into any endeavor he believes will make someone else’s life better. 
#### Notes
---
- Dreadwind and Darkwing are [Those Two Guys](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys). They are Mirror Mirror’s Blue Beetle and Booster Gold.
