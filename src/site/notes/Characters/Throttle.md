A [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticon]] [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Frametype\|gunformer]], [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Spark Bond\|binary-bonded]] to [[Characters/Darkwing\|Darkwing]].  Throttle tries his best to be the cordial sort, always trying to see the best in others… with some exceptions, that is. 

Where his and [[Characters/Hi-Test\|Hi-Test’s]] partners get along swimmingly, Throttle and Hi-Test utterly despise one another for reasons even they can’t explain. Where Hi-Test has made his distaste quite clear to Dreadwind, Hi-Test goes out of his way to keep Darkwing in the dark about this little rivalry. 

Hilariously enough, their partners being [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Spark Bond\|Amica Endurae]] is not the only obstacle standing in the way of their goal of never interacting with each other again. [[Characters/Forestock\|Forestock]] has managed to befriend the both of them, and neither would ever dream of asking him to abandon his friendship with the other. It seems they are doomed to begrudgingly tolerate one another until the end of time. 
#### Notes
---
- While most Targetmaster, Powermaster, etc. pairs are comprised of a Cybertronian and a [Nebulan](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Nebulan) in canon, I’ve decided that most of these Nebulans are Cybertronian gunformers in Mirror Mirror. 
- Hi-Test and Throttle canonically transform into components for their respective partners, but that would be… well, that would be body horror on par with Human Centipede for a Mirror Mirror Cybertronian, so they’re guns instead.
