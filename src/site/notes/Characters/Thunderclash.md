An [[M.T.O.\|M.T.O.]] turned [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticon]] medic, built by the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Cybertronian Unification\|government]] during the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Decepticon Uprising\|Decepticon Uprising]]. 
##### Notes
---
- This is Mirror Mirror [Ambulon](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ambulon).  He was never used for any sort of combiner experiment on account of combiners not existing Mirror Mirror (the size issues alone…) and thus he kept his original name, which I’ve decided was Thunderclash. 
- While making him a Decepticon defector was the obvious choice, I felt it would be much more interesting for various traitors and defectors to be defined by their loyalty instead, in the same way Shattered Glass takes on Starscream are utterly devoted to Megatron.
