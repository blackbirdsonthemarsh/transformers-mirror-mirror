The first [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Primacy\|Prime]] to rule over a [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Cybertronian Unification\|unified Cybertron]]. Unlike [[Zeta Prime\|those]] who would [[Characters/Sentinel Prime\|succeed]] him, Nominus knew how to win the people’s love— and he knew how to [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Decepticon Uprising\|keep it]]. 

Unlike his predecessor, [[Characters/Nova Prime\|Nova Prime]], and unlike every Prime before him, he did not possess the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Matrix\|Matrix]], though this was a secret he took to his grave.

- Mirror Mirror Nominus Prime is a combination of [Nominus Prime](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Nominus_Prime) from IDW, and [Guardian Prime](tfwiki guardian prime) from G1. He takes his design, name, and lying about being a Matrix-bearer from IDW, but he takes his role as the leader of a post-Quintesson Cybertron, and his reign being an era of peace from Guardian Prime. Guardian was his Mirror Mirror Nominus Prime’s original name.
