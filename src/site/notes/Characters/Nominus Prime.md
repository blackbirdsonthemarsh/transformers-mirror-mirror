The first [[Lore/History, Society and Culture/Primacy\|Prime]] to rule over a [[Lore/History, Society and Culture/Cybertronian Unification\|unified Cybertron]]. Unlike [[Zeta Prime\|those]] who would [[Characters/Sentinel Prime\|succeed]] him, Nominus knew how to win the people’s love— and he knew how to [[Lore/History, Society and Culture/Decepticon Uprising\|keep it]]. 

Unlike his predecessor, [[Characters/Nova Prime\|Nova Prime]], and unlike every Prime before him, he did not possess the [[Matrix\|Matrix]], though this was a secret he took to his grave.
