There are few ‘bots who can claim to be sterner than [[Characters/Krok\|Krok]], dourer than [[Characters/Thunderclash\|Thunderclash]], or more irritable than [[Characters/Shockwave\|Shockwave]]. Twirl isn’t an easy ‘bot to get along with, and fortunately for everyone around her, she knows it. She’s a bit of an enigma among the [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticons]], as even those who’ve fought beside her for years admit they hardly know anything about her— most can count the conversations they’ve had with her on one hand. If not for the fame of her line, nobody would even know where she was [[Polities of Cybertron/Polyhex\|made.]] Her [[Cybertronian Biology/Reproduction\|batchmates]] claim she’s wonderful once you get to know her, but that would require having a conversation about more than just tactics.
##### Notes

- The ability of Twirl and her line to be able to sleep mid-flight is a nod to the B-2 Spirit’s extensive flight systems, which are constantly making all sorts of miniscule adjustments to keep it in the air. On account of Cybertronian aircraft essentially being fly-by-wire systems given sentience, I decided to interpret the B-2’s particular quirks as a highly advanced autopilot system that lets them take mid-flight naps.
