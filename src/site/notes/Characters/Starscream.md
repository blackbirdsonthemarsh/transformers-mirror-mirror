##### Notes
---
- Mirror Mirror Starscream is, plainly and simply, a killing machine. A killing machine who chose instead to dedicate himself to the study and preservation of life, life that is unimaginably fragile compared to him. He is a microcosm of Mirror Mirror’s themes regarding autonomy, destiny, and the way one grapples with being created to fulfil another’s agenda. 
- During his time on Earth, he adopted an [F-15 STOL/MTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-15_STOL/MTD) as his Earth disguise. I chose this alternate mode because Starscream turned into an F-15 in G1, and because this particular model of F-15 was most famously used by NASA, and Mirror Mirror Starscream studied space for the majority of his pre-war life. It’s even primarily white, with red accents! 
- Starscream being the inventor of the [[Cybertron/Technology/Fusion Cannon\|Fusion Cannon]] is a nod to IDW Starscream giving Megatron his signature weapon. Given that parallels are (obviously) drawn between Megatron and [[Characters/Megatronus Prime\|Megatronus Prime]] and [[Characters/Megatron\|Megatron]], this particular detail has created unintended parallels between Starscream and [[Solus Prime\|Solus Prime]], the black and white jet known for brilliant, seemingly impossible inventions who gave Megatronus his [[Reqiuem Blaster\|signature arm-mounted cannon]]. Given that the Decepticons [[Cybertron/Primus\|finish what the Thirteen started]], I really wish I could say that I had come up with all of this from the beginning. 
- His friendship with Sunstorm is a nod to them being brothers in several continuities. Of course, this being Shattered Glass, their relationship is quite cute.
