#### Notes
---
- Due to the… [confusing nature of Nightstick(s)](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Nightstick_(disambiguation)/grid) I must clarify that *this* Nightstick is based on the [Nebulan criminal bonded to Cyclonus](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Nightstick_(G1)). 
- While most Targetmaster pairs are comprised of a Cybertronian and their [Nebulan](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Nebulan) weapon in canon, I’ve decided that most of these Nebulans are Cybertronian gunformers in Mirror Mirror.
