##### Notes

- This event is primarily inspired by the destruction of [Crystal City](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Crystal_City#Shattered_Glass) in the Fun Publications Shattered Glass continuity,  and the destruction of [Vos](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Vos_(polity)#Generation_1_continuity_family) via photon missile in the Marvel UK continuity. 
- One of the central themes of Mirror Mirror is the ways that brutality backfires. The [[Quintessons\|Quintessons]]â€™ empire fell apart after their defeat during the [[History, Society and Culture/Quintesson War\|Quintesson War]], because each and every species and civilization they had wronged smelled blood in the water and converged upon them. The [[History, Society and Culture/Primacy\|Primacy]] was doomed to fall due to internal pressures as life became less and less livable. The [[The Great War/Factions/Autobots/Autobot\|Autobots]], in a show of force meant to scare the planet into submission, galvanized it against them and handed the Decepticons an unshakable base of support in the form of the surviving Vosians.  The Autobots lying about negotiations ensured that nobody would ever trust them even if they *were* genuine.
