The [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticon]] answer to [[The Great War/Factions/Autobots/Wreckers\|the Wreckers]]. 

##### Notes
---
- While they are largely based on their origins in Marvel G1, Mayhem’s roster in Mirror Mirror is  a combination of the [Mayhem Attack Squad](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Mayhem_Attack_Squad) from Marvel G1, the [Mayhem Suppression Squad](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Mayhem_Suppression_Squad) from Fun Publications Shattered Glass, [Squadron X](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Squadron_X) from IDW, and the [Decepticon Heavy Brigade](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Decepticon_Heavy_Brigade) from Animated.  This is largely because I needed to flesh out several different rosters under several different leaders, and taking members from already existing Wreckers counterparts was the natural choice. 
- On a related note, Mayhem’s lineage of leaders is an amalgamation of various continuities, with some original choices. Crasher as its first leader comes from Fun Publications Shattered Glass, Thunderwing as its second comes purely from my own fondness for the character, and Bludgeon as its third leader comes from Marvel G1. Macabre being offered the position but turning it down was a nod to his role as the leader of an ill-fated Wreckers counterpart in IDW.
- Carnivac and Catilla are typically associated with Mayhem, but I had a much different role in mind for them in Mirror Mirror. 
- The Scavengers are a delightful collection of random nobodies in IDW, but several of its members are either members of Mayhem in other continuities, or associated with one of its leaders. Thus, I decided to associate the two in Mirror Mirror, with the Scavengers being patterned after Mayhem, meant to be smaller and more covert.
