A squadron of [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticons\|Decepticon]] [[Cybertronian Biology/Outliers\|outliers]], one 'bot armies capable of not only winning battles, but liberating planets by themselves. 

Though they were a symbol of hope to the Decepticons, their creation weighs heavily on [[Characters/Starscream\|Starscream's mind]]. Each and every component, down to the smallest joint in their frames, had to be rebuilt out of [[Cybertron/Ununtrium\|ununtrium]] in a long and dangerous process that risked the lives of each and every volunteer.
