Transformers: Mirror Mirror is a Shattered Glass fan-continuity. Welcome to its worldbuilding wiki, which is currently under construction. 

Where the original Shattered Glass storyline was a parody, Mirror Mirror aims to take a more serious approach that leans into the more fantastical elements of Transformers, with a touch of cosmic horror. Should I ever get around to writing it, Mirror Mirror will touch on themes of destiny, what it means to be created for another’s agenda, the horrors of war, the self-destructive nature of authoritarianism, what if being created in God’s image was a bad thing, and whether we can learn from our history and build a better world. 

This should go without saying, but should Mirror Mirror ever be written, this will effectively spoil the entirety of it. 
##### FAQ and Trivia
---
**Why was Mirror Mirror created?**
For a fan-continuity that has lasted for more than half a decade and lead to a saga of friendship, betrayal and self-discovery, Mirror Mirror has surprisingly humble origins. When I was a middle schooler, I wanted to see a Shattered Glass take on the original Generation One cartoon, so I decided to write one. I thought it would be fun to start it off from the perspective of the four seekers that Bumblebee and Wheeljack met in the first episode, which quickly set the tone for the continuity, and provided me with a narrator.  One thing lead to another, and I've been working on this continuity on and off for the past six years, and given how much it means to me, I’ll stop when I’m dead. 

**When was Mirror Mirror created?** 
My younger self never expected Mirror Mirror to be more than just a Shattered Glass version of the original Generation One cartoon, so they never bothered to write down the specific day— believe me, I’ve been kicking myself for that. All I can say for certain is that it was created some time from 2017-2018, perhaps 2016 at the earliest. 

**Who all works on Mirror Mirror?**
Just me. 

**Does Mirror Mirror's universal stream have a name?**
Iterastris -019.17 Iota! The name itself is a reference to Star Trek, a series that Mirror Mirror owes not just its title, but its very existence to! The 019 and .17 come from the date (provided memory serves) I first posted online about the continuity, though it had existed for some time before that. [For those who may be confused.](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Universal_stream) Because I am most certainly not a nerd, every other fan-continuity I have has a designation as well, including (but most certainly not limited to) Iterastris -021.25, Primax 025.19 Iota and Primax -025.19 Iota.

**You mentioned a narrator?**
Narrator might not be the best word to describe him... Mirror Mirror exists in-universe (under a very different title) as a historical document put together by Bitstream, who made it his mission to collect as many firsthand accounts of the war, the events that lead up to it, and its impacts as he could.

**How did you pick the cast?**
Largely based on my own personal preferences, with a bit of bias towards more obscure characters. I went out of my way to use characters who had interesting concepts, but (at the time, things have changed quite a bit since I created this continuity) very few appearances. Characters like Lyzack, Esmeral, Full-tilt, Outback, Thunderblast and Aimless are some of my favorite obscure Transformers characters, and they’ve been given quite a bit of attention in Mirror Mirror. The heavy emphasis on the Welcoming Committee Seekers (Hotlink, Bitstream, Sunstorm and Nacelle) and other underdeveloped (at the time) G1 Decepticons like the Rainmakers came from Mirror Mirror’s original premise.

**What was the original premise?**
A series following the events of the G1 cartoon, from the perspective of the Decepticons who stayed on Cybertron when the Ark and the Nemesis set off. This, as previously mentioned, set the tone for the continuity and despite how much has changed, you can still feel it even today. The primary antagonists are still Elita One and her team, and the assorted Seekers stationed on Cybertron are all major characters. 

**Have you written anything for Mirror Mirror?**
I have, quite a bit! About 20-30k words, split between the main narrative itself and several side stories. All of this has since been scrapped, so unless we’re particularly close, you’re not going to be reading it any time soon. The scope of the story got unmanageable, so I decided to take a multi-year break from writing to refine my ideas, sharpen my skills, and beat the project into a much more manageable shape. The current plan is to write various small works all set in the same continuity, with an overarching narrative unifying them all. 

**What series influenced Mirror Mirror?**
When it comes to Transformers? Practically the whole franchise. I've been a Transformers fan for as long as I can remember, and while Mirror Mirror will always have its roots in the G1 cartoon, it takes from just about everything. The list of Transformers series that haven't had at least some influence on Mirror Mirror is comedically short, and will only grow shorter. Outside the franchise? Star Trek, as previously cited, and several works in the mecha genre, chief among them the Yuusha series and Getter Robo.  
 
**Do you have any other fan-continuities?**
Yes, several! They range from projects I'm working on with friends, to alternate universes that spiraled out of control, to premises for Transformers series that have been rattling around in my head for far longer than they should have. Though I'm proud to say that Mirror Mirror is the oldest of the bunch! All but one of them are, or heavily involve, Shattered Glass.

**Why Shattered Glass?** 
The mirror universe trope has always fascinated me, and it’s something I explore in both fanfiction and original works, with with a series like Transformers, where so much is divided along the lines of good and evil? It’s fascinating. There *is* objective, cosmic good in Transformers in the form of Primus and the Matrix, so what happens when you flip that around? What does it mean to be created by something evil? While I love the original Fun Publications Shattered Glass story, I wanted to take a more serious approach (though, I haven’t stripped it of all the [[Lost Light\|goofiness]]) to really explore the potential of a mirror universe outside of a parody setting where everything’s dialed up to eleven. 

**Who hurt you?**
This question tends to come up a lot when I tell people about Mirror Mirror. [[Cybertron/Primus\|I]] [[Characters/Galvatron\|can't]] [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Shadowplay\|imagine]] [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Culture/Empurata\|why.]]
