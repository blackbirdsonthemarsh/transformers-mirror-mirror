Transformers: Mirror Mirror is a Shattered Glass fan-continuity. Welcome to its worldbuilding wiki, which is currently under construction.  

Where the original Shattered Glass storyline was a parody, Mirror Mirror aims to take a more serious approach. 

> [!info]- FAQ and Trivia
> >**Why was Mirror Mirror created?**
> >For a fan-continuity that has lasted for more than half a decade and lead to a saga of friendship, betrayal and self-discovery, Mirror Mirror has surprisingly humble origins. When I was a middle schooler, I wanted to see a Shattered Glass take on the original Generation One cartoon, so I decided to write one. I thought it would be fun to start it off from the perspective of the four seekers that Bumblebee and Wheeljack met in the first episode, which quickly set the tone for the continuity, and provided me with a narrator.  One thing lead to another, and I've been working on this continuity on and off for the past six years.

> >**When was Mirror Mirror created?** 
> > My younger self never expected Mirror Mirror to be more than just a Shattered Glass version of the original Generation One cartoon, so they never bothered to write down the specific day. All I can say for certain is that it was created some time from 2017-2018.

> > Iterastris -019.17 Iota! The name itself is a reference to Star Trek, a series that Mirror Mirror owes not just its title, but its very existence to! The 019 and .17 come from the date (provided memory serves) I first posted online about the continuity, though it had existed for some time before that. [For those who may be confused.](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Universal_stream)

> >**You mentioned a narrator?**
> >Narrator might not be the best word to describe him... Mirror Mirror exists in-universe (under a very different title) as a historical document put together by Bitstream, who made it his mission to collect as many firsthand accounts of the war, the events that lead up to it, and its impacts as he could.

> >  **What series influenced Mirror Mirror?**
> > When it comes to Transformers? Practically the whole franchise. I've been a Transformers fan for as long as I can remember, and while Mirror Mirror will always have its roots in the G1 cartoon, it takes from just about everything. The list of Transformers series that haven't had at least some influence on Mirror Mirror is comedically short, and will only grow shorter. Outside the franchise? Star Trek, as previously cited, and several works in the mecha genre, chief among them Getter Robo.  
> > 
>> **Do you have any other fan-continuities?**
> Yes, several! They range from projects I'm working on with friends, to alternate universes that spiraled out of control, to premises for Transformers series that have been rattling around in my head for far longer than they should have. I'm proud to say that Mirror Mirror is the oldest of the bunch, and the one that has been in development (very messy development) for the longest.
