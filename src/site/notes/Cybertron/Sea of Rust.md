An inland sea on [[Cybertron\|Cybertron]], known for its treacherous weather, hostile wildlife, and near-constant storms brewing along its surface that often escalate into hurricanes. The landscape around it is… strange, to say the least, the shores of the sea bent and warped like a poorly-healed wound. Energon crystals form on its surface, resembling plants, wildlife, and sometimes even Cybertronians.

It is said that the Sea of Rust is a scar left upon [[Cybertron/Primus\|Primus]] during his battle with [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Primus, Unicron and Gaea\|Unicron]], that still has yet to heal. 

The city of [[Cybertron/Polities of Cybertron/Polyhex\|Polyhex]] floats over its shores, and the [[Cybertron/Hydrax Plateau\|Hydrax Plateau]] floats miles above its center.
##### Notes

- The Sea of Rust, much like the [[Cybertron/Mithril Sea\|Mithril Sea]] and the [[Cybertron/Argon Sea\|Argon Sea]] are actual bodies of water in Mirror Mirror. These three seas are not the only seas on Cybertron, either, but they are the only seas relevant to Cybertronian civilization, because the others are too far from any [[Hot Spot\|hot spots]] to have any meaningful population. 
- While Beast Wars: Uprising is not a continuity I’m particularly fond of (the Beast Wars sections of the franchise have consistently failed to grab me) it has one of the richest depictions of Cybertron (the planet) the franchise has ever had, incorporating all sorts of obscure locations and fleshing out existing ones. Thus, its depiction of Cybertron has heavily influenced Mirror Mirror. Though, a lot of details are flat-out made up.
