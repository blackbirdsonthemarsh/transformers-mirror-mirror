Transwarp space, or “unspace” is the yawning nothingness that exists between realities. For those of us living in one reality, this endless nothing makes quite the convenient shortcut, allowing everything from individuals to starships to swap places with something else in the universe, meaning one can cover vast distances in (what seems like) seconds. 

All Cybertronian starships above a certain size class are equipped with teleporters and internal [[Cybertron/Technology/Space Bridge\|space bridges]] that take advantage of unspace. Teleporters are used to send personnel planetside while the ship remains in orbit, while space bridges allow the ship itself (and anything making physical contact with it) to travel vast distances instantaneously. 

There are two kinds of space bridge used in ships, one that is standard across all Cybertronian starships, capable of only shunting the ship and whatever is inside it, and a much larger, much more energy-intensive variety only found on capital ships, capable of opening up stable portals that other ships can follow them through. Teleporters are also used on ships above a certain size to ensure that one is able to get from one end of the ship to the other (or to various points on the ship in general) in a reasonable amount of time.

Some [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Outlier\|outliers]] are capable of entering and exiting unspace at will, and they report being able to see the reality they came from, and even interact with it, though time seems desynced between

One is never alone here. It’s best to close any channels of communications before making a jump, and to keep away from windows. 
##### Notes
---
- Cybertronian ships using teleporters to send crew planetside is a nod to Star Trek, and it’s convenient from a writing perspective. 
- Teleportation in Mirror Mirror is extremely dangerous, as it swaps the teleporter with whatever is present at their intended destination. Should a jump be miscalculated, the best case scenario involves finding oneself partially trapped in a solid object. This is occasionally used as a kamikaze tactic by smaller starships, who will teleport themselves into the bridges or engines of larger ships, destroying both. [[Characters/Skywarp\|Skywarp]] is quite fond of teleporting himself into his opponents, essentially using himself to instantly impale them.
