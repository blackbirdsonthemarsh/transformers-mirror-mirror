##### Notes

- Despite the fact that they have been banned since before he was built, Mirror Mirror Prowl has terrible luck with encountering foldspace warheads. He has taught himself how to disarm them as a precaution, but he has never been able to put these skills to use because any time he finds himself around one, it always ends up going off because of circumstances entirely outside of his control. He was even encountering them _before the war_ which is... concerning!
