[[Characters/Megatron\|Megatron’s]] signature weapon and Starscream’s most terrifying invention, an arm-mounted cannon powered by antimatter siphoned from a black hole. The cannon has a range of twelve miles, and one shot is capable of obliterating a small town. 
##### Notes
---
- While [[Characters/Starscream\|Starscream]] inventing the cannon is my own invention, him giving it to Megatron as a gift is a nod to IDW. 
- [[Characters/Prowl\|Prowl]], whose life can only be described as patently insane, considers Starscream a nutcase for having invented such a thing. 
- Megatron’s fusion cannon is largely inspired by its desciption in his [G1 bio](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/b/bc/MegsMarvTFU.jpg).
