Null-rays are capable of disabling any and all technology, whether living or non-living, with one shot. They were invented as a counter to [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Inbuilt Weaponry\|inbuilt weaponry]], in order to disarm ‘bots with built-in weapons without resorting to amputation.
##### Notes
---
- While they may look like null-rays, the cannons mounted on [[Characters/Starscream\|Starscream’s]] arms (and the arms of other Seekers) are laser or ion rotary cannons, firing anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000 rounds per minute.
