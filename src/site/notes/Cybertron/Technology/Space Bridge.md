A form of travel that, via a “shortcut” through [[Cybertron/Technology/Transwarp\|transwarp space]], allows instantaneous teleportation to almost anywhere in the universe. 

Early space bridges were quite inefficient, requiring a bridge at both ends, with a stable connection between them that, if disrupted, would obliterate anything being sent through. These early bridges took some time to power up, and could take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to send something through, depending on its size. They also, oddly enough, resembled bridges. 

The space bridges of today, however, are remarkably energy-efficient compared to their predecessors, and are a standard — mundane, even — part of any starship above a certain size class. They’re an essential part of Cybertronian trade, and without them, Cybertronian civilization as we know it could not exist.
