“Multi-changer” is a catch-all term for Cybertronians with more than two forms. Some may have [[Blitzwing\|two alternate modes]], others may have four, [[Characters/Sixshot\|or even six]]. Some have [[Counterpunch\|two robot modes]], and strangest of all, some [[Flywheels\|split in half when they transform]], [[Overlord\|inhabiting two separate bodies simultaneously]]. 

Notable multi-changers in Mirror Mirror include:
- [[Characters/Sixshot\|Sixshot]]
- [[Nightbird\|Nightbird]]
- [[Quickswitch\|Quickswitch]]
- [[Characters/Sentinel Prime\|Sentinel Prime]]
- [[Blitzwing\|Blitzwing]]
- [[Astrotrain\|Astrotrain]]
- [[Octane\|Octane]]
- [[Flywheels\|Flywheels]]
- [[Battletrap\|Battletrap]]
- [[Overlord\|Overlord]] 
- [[Springer\|Springer]]
- [[Sandstorm\|Sandstorm]]
- [[Characters/Airachnid\|Airachnid]]
- [[Counterpunch\|Counterpunch]]
- [[Characters/Rampage\|Rampage]]

Multi-changers, with the exception of those who split in half during their transformations, are almost always forged. This is because of the mechanical complexity inherent in their transformations, and the fact that having two alternate modes, especially if these alternate modes are wildly different, necessitates compromising one or both modes. Both the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Primacy\|inter-war government]] and the [[The Great War/Factions/Autobots/Autobot\|Autobots]] deemed it too expensive to even bother making mass-production molds for triple-changers, let alone quad-changers, when you could build multiple molds that have to compromise nothing about their design for the same price. However, there were the [[Overlord\|occasional]] [[Characters/Rampage\|one-offs]].

Multi-changers who split in half were the product of a brief experimental line produced under [[Zeta Prime\|Zeta Prime’s]] reign. A handful of ‘bots were produced, before the line was deemed not cost-effective enough to bother with any further. 

Six-changers are exclusively forged, because the complexity of their designs meant that no attempts were made to begin with. Due to their complexity and the strain put on their sparks, six-changers often have disabilities or deformities, such as missing color nanites, or an [[Nightbird\|improperly-formed vocalizer]].
##### Notes
---
- Mirror Mirror Nightbird being a six-changer with a close relationship with Sixshot is a nod to her becoming a six-changer under his guidance in the Legends continuity. When I say that Mirror Mirror takes inspiration from just about every corner of the franchise, I mean it!
- Duocons and Duobots are folded into the category of multi-changers for convenience’s sake. Mirror Mirror Duocons are one ‘bot with two alternate modes, each with its own brain module and spark— meaning that if one of their bodies was destroyed, they would simply be trapped in one of their alternate modes. 
- Due to Mirror Mirror not really having mass-shifting, multi-changers are in a bit of an awkward situation. I’ve decided to incorporate the bizarre scaling problems that come with this into the lore, particularly when it comes to six-changers. This size issue also means that characters like [[Broadside\|Broadside]] or [[Characters/Tidal Wave\|Tidal Wave]] only have one alternate mode in Mirror Mirror, because the alternative would be either hilarious terrifying, depending on which alternate mode they’re scaled to. 
- Despite having three forms, [[Titan\|Titans]] are not considered multi-changers, because having multiple modes simply comes with the territory of being a Titan. 
- Characters with modifications that allow their car modes to fly, like [[Tracks\|Tracks]] or [[Road Rage\|Road Rage]], or go underwater like [[Characters/Prowl\|Prowl]], do not count as multi-changers. They are considered to have one alternate mode.
