The output of a Cybertronian [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Spark\|spark]], which is the average amount of power it generates under normal conditions, is determined by a multitude of factors, ranging from the size of its owner, to the conditions in which it emerged. Naturally, a the spark of someone who transforms into an aircraft carrier would generate far more powerful than the spark of a motorcycle, or a rifle. Then, there are ‘bots whose output has nothing to do with their frametype, 

Some sparks have an enormous output, bordering on nonsensical.

##### Notes
---
- In Mirror Mirror, [Outliers](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Outlier_(group)) and [Point One Percenters](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Point_One_Percenter) are one in the same, and the terms themselves are interchangeable.  Mirror Mirror’s outliers have the unusual, seemingly random powers of IDW’s outliers, and the strange colors, incredible power and monumentally dangerous nature of IDW’s point one percenters.
- Outliers and the practically reality-breaking nature of their powers are a hint that Cybertronians are… [[Cybertron/Primus\|not exactly a normal species]]. 
- There was no [Jhiaxian Academy of Advanced Technology](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Jhiaxian_Academy_of_Advanced_Technology) in Mirror Mirror, partially because outliers were not persecuted and thus there was no need to keep them hidden away from a wider Cybertron, and partially because [[Characters/Shockwave\|Shockwave]] would be a comedically horrible teacher and he is very aware of it.
