“Deployer” refers to [[Cybertronians\|Cybertronians]] who have chosen to form symbiotic partnerships with smaller members of their species. 

The only notable deployer in Mirror Mirror is [[Characters/Soundwave\|Soundwave]], partnered with [[Characters/Ravage\|Ravage]], [[Characters/Howlback\|Howlback]], [[Characters/Flip Sides\|Flip Sides]], [[Characters/Frenzy\|Frenzy]] and [[Characters/Rumble\|Rumble]]. Each of them turns into a small, high-speed aircraft that launches from his alternate mode. 
##### Notes

- Due to Mirror Mirror lacking the mass-shifting that is present in the rest of the franchise, Cybertronians turning into micro-cassettes would be… problematic, to say the least. How in the world does one write a conversation between someone who is sixty feet tall, and someone who’s only a couple of centimeters? That’s not getting into the question of how they’d go about their lives without being stepped on by larger members of their species. Thus, I have decided to turn them into [parasite aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_aircraft) or aircraft like the [X-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-40) or the [X-43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_X-43) that require the assistance of [launch vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle), or are [drop launched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_test#Experimental_aircraft). This preserves the dynamic without leaving a good chunk of the cast practically microscopic. Similarly, most characters who turn into components like heads, engine blocks, etc. are now guns, effectively folding Headmasters and Powermasters into the category of Targetmaster. There are some [[Characters/Rewind\|exceptions]] of course, where I’ve decided they’ll be regular vehicles instead.
