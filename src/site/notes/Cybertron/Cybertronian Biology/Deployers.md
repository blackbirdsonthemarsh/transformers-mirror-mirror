“Deployer” refers to [[Cybertronians\|Cybertronians]] who have chosen to form symbiotic partnerships with smaller members of their species. 

The only notable deployer in Mirror Mirror is [[Characters/Soundwave\|Soundwave]], partnered with [[Characters/Ravage\|Ravage]], [[Characters/Howlback\|Howlback]], [[Characters/Flip Sides\|Flip Sides]], [[Characters/Frenzy\|Frenzy]] and [[Characters/Rumble\|Rumble]]. Each of them turns into a small, high-speed aircraft that launches from his alternate mode. 
##### Notes
---
- Most micro-cassettes in Mirror Mirror are [parasite aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_aircraft) or aircraft like the [X-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-40) or the [X-43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_X-43) that require the assistance of [launch vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle), or are [drop launched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_test#Experimental_aircraft). Similarly, most characters who turn into components like heads, engine blocks, etc. are now guns. There are some [[Characters/Rewind\|exceptions]] of course.
