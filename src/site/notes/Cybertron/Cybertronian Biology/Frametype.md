“Frametype” is a term that refers to the broad category that a Cybertronian’s alternate mode falls under. The term refers to groupings of similar alternate modes, such as rifles, or fighter jets, rather than broader categories like aircraft. For example, [[Characters/Starscream\|Starscream]] and [[Characters/Lyzack\|Lyzack]] have very different alternate modes, with Starscream being a dedicated air superiority fighter, while Lyzack is a carrier-capable strike fighter with extensive electronic warfare capabilities. However, at the end of the day, they are both fighter jets, and thus would be referred to as having the same frametype. 

[[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Multi-changers\|Multi-changers]] make the situation slightly more complex, as they possess multiple alternate modes that often have very little to do with each other. Triple-changer, quad-changer, six-changer, etc. are considered frametypes unto themselves, due to the fact that having multiple alternate modes causes certain effects on the body, and individual multi-changers also belong to the various frametypes their alternate modes fall under. 

In the case of Cybertronians who transform into objects, the suffix -former is occasionally appended to their frametype (ex: gunformer) to avoid confusion. 
#### Notes
---
- Gunformers will have their alternate mode link to this page, to clarify that they are in fact people, and not a gun with a name, as those [[Requiem Blaster\|do exist]].
- The term is seen as rather formal, and using it in casual conversation outside of specific situations would result in many puzzled looks. It would be akin to calling humans hominids, or randomly using felid to refer to your friend’s house cat.
