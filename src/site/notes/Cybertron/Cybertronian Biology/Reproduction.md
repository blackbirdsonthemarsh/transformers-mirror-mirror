No mechanical organism is capable of sexual reproduction. Cybertronians originate from [[Hot Spot\|hot spots]], which themselves originate either from [[Vector Sigma\|Vector Sigma]], or the [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Spark\|spark]] of a [[Titan\|Titan]]. Cybertronian sparks form deep underground on the topmost layer of [[Cybertron\|Cybertron]], where they spend the next several centuries slowly making their way to the surface.  

If left undisturbed, these sparks will lay on the surface for decades, if not centuries, until conditions are favorable.

From the moment Mirror Mirror became an original continuity rather a Shattered Glass take on Generation One, I knew cold construction was going to be a part of it. 
- Cold construction is an extension of the militarism of pre-war Cybertron, and a direct product of its dystopic conditions. Unlike in IDW, where cold construct sparks are meaningfully different, in Mirror Mirror, they are essentially, forged Cybertronians who were robbed of not just their ability to find their true shape, but their very childhoods as a result of a paranoid and militaristic government that wanted to create the perfect war machine. “What if the United States government contracted Lockheed Martin to build people?”
