All [[Cybertronians\|Cybertronians]] begin their lives as [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Spark\|sparks]], fracturing either from the spark of [[Cybertron/Primus\|Primus]] himself, or that of one of the [[Titan\|Titans]].

On [[Cybertron\|Cybertron]], sparks form on the topmost layer of the planet, miles below the surface. They spend the next several millennia making their way to the surface of the planet, where they will lay dormant for decades, if not centuries. When conditions are favorable, these sparks will violently explode, superheating the [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Living Metal\|living metal]] around them in a process called “ignition.” After ignition, living metal will coalesce around the spark, following the instructions written into the spark itself to build a body. 

Sparks, with very few exceptions, emerge and ignite in a few dozen locations across the planet, known as either sparkfields, or hot spots. The rate at which sparks ignite is extraordinarily low, though it varies from hot spot to hot spot, and it is entirely possible for hot spots to go dormant and release thousands of years'‘ worth of sparks practically at once. This curious method of reproduction has profoundly shaped Cybertronian history, society, and culture. Due to the fact that Cybertronian reproduction is tied to hot spots, it makes cities that are sufficiently far from one dependent entirely upon immigration (or, later, cold construction) to grow their population, making the possibility of Cybertronian civilization spreading off-world somewhere between unfeasible and impossible. 

Due to the fact that Cybertronians depend wholly upon sparkfields for their population, the vast majority of political entities on Cybertron have been city-states built around a cluster of hot spots, controlling vast swathes of sparsely-inhabited territory, or small nations controlling a handful of cities, themselves clustered around a group of hot spots. The sole exception was the unified Cybertronian government that formed in the wake of the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Quintesson War\|Quintesson War]], which saw the various city-states and nations of Cybertron brought under a single government, ruling out of [[Cybertron/Polities/Iacon\|Iacon]]. 

In the wake of the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Quintesson War\|Quintesson War]], the Cybertronian population had been reduced by more than half. The state of the planet lead to widespread panic as to when, if ever, the Cybertronian species would get back to pre-war numbers, and when combined with the fear of another invasion, the newly-formed Cybertronian government began to look into ways of raising the Cybertronian population, to bolster the economy, and rebuild Cybertron’s armies. 

Under the reign of [[Characters/Nominus Prime\|Nominus Prime]], the process of cold construction was developed. The term “cold construct” comes from the fact that the process involves taking a spark crystal that has yet to ignite and placing it in a pre-built frame, and performing a controlled ignition afterwards. Essentially, the sparks are cold when they enter their frame. 

In [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Quintesson War\|times]] of [[The Great War/Great War\|war]] and political turmoil, [[M.T.O.\|concerns]] regarding population have never been far from the [[Characters/Sentinel Prime\|minds]] [[Senate\|of]] [[Zeta Prime\|Cybertron’s]] [[Characters/Nominus Prime\|leaders]].

**Sparklings**
The term “sparkling” refers to a developing Cybertronian that has not yet reached adulthood. 

Sparklings begin their lives as remarkably lumpy creatures with something resembling optics, and a hole in their head that could be called a mouth, and little else. In the first few hours of their lives, sparklings are practically liquid, and they stay rather soft to the touch for the first few months. 

When these lumps begin to solidify, they start to take on a more distinct shape, with large optics, a very large mouth, and nubs for limbs. After they do solidify, they enter a brief (but memorable) state of ravenous hunger, where they do little else but eat, devouring any metal within reach, regardless of whether it is the living metal that makes up the planet, or the floor they are sitting on. This is their frame preparing for growth, stockpiling the necessary material to build their future body.

After they’ve consumed enough metal, they enter a state that could almost be described as hibernation, where they largely only sleep and grow, taking on a smaller version of what will become their final, adult shape. The first parts to to take on a distinct form are their face and hands. This is the stage where their [kibble](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Kibble) begins to develop, and it tends to be quite oversized for the small body it belongs to. Often, sparklings will have no idea what to do with their new kibble, and their natural curiosity compared with their small size leads to all sorts of mishaps, ranging from little tanks shooting holes in the ceiling, to tiny jets soaring out the window on thrusters they didn’t have yesterday. 

The next stage is the one they’ll spend the majority of their childhood in, and it’s considered to have begun when the Cybertronian is capable of transforming for the very first time. They’re smaller than they will be upon adulthood

The final appearance of a Cybertronian

While Cybertronians have a childhood, it is 

**Family**
What a “normal life” is varies wildly across Cybertron, as does the idea of family and what it even means How, exactly, sparklings are handled depends on the city-state and its culture. 

In Vos, sparklings will be given to a mentor that is charged with caring for them, teaching them about the world, and helping them integrate into society. The idea of family and kinship as something that is inherent beyond the case of literal split-spark kin does not exist in Vos— yes, sparklings will be cared for by older Cybertronians for an extended period of time, but the idea that these are their parents or that they should have any kind of special bond past sparklinghood is entirely up to individual choice. 

[[Characters/Bitstream\|Bitstream]] continues to visit his caretaker, who he and his brother [[Sunstorm\|Sunstorm]] regard as family— though they do not necessarily view them as a parent. [[Characters/Flyhigh\|Flyhigh]], on the other hand, barely thinks about his caretaker and regards them simply as the person responsible for ensuring he made it to adulthood successfully and could integrate into society (and he thinks they did a crap job of it, anyhow) and though he knows ‘bots who were raised by the same caretaker, he doesn’t regard them as kin, or really, significant to him in any way. 

In Tarn, a sparkling’s caretakers are akin to teachers, rather than parents. They prepare a sparkling (or sparklings, in the case of split-spark siblings) for adulthood, but unlike Vos, they aren’t really viewed as any form of kin, period, though you are expected to remain close to them later in life. Unlike Vos, where most ‘bots will be assigned one caretaker, sparklings will be given to groups of two or more (typically friends) and will be looked after by their social circles.

[[Characters/Megatron\|Megatron]] and [[Characters/Galvatron\|Galvatron]] were raised by [[Characters/Terminus\|Terminus]], [[Characters/Termagax\|Termagax]], and their fellow miners. Even into their adulthood, they’ve remained close, but they regard them as mentors, rather than kin. 

Polyhex, on the other hand, _does_ regard sparklings’ caretakers as their family, and it’s entirely normal for ‘bots to form platonic spark bonds (there are lots of different kinds of spark bonds in Mirror Mirror, with different levels of intensity— spark bonding is seen as a deeply emotional act, among people with strong relationships, though the nature of that relationships and the bond itself is up to them) with their caretakers. They don’t use the word “parent” but for them, “caretaker” and “mentor” might as well mean the same thing. A sparkling will have one (and only one) primary caretaker, but they will be raised communally. A caretaker’s kin (both in the sense of being raised by or with them, and elective kin, conjunxes, and amica) will be regarded as kin of their sparkling

Helex has a similar approach to parenthood as Polyhex, though a sparkling there can have multiple primary caretakers.

In Kalis, sparklings are raised communally in what are essentially state-run boarding schools. The only kinship that exists there is elective or spark-based.

##### Notes
---
- While the term “constructed cold” came from IDW, I decided to take things in a very different direction. In Mirror Mirror, there is no difference between forged and cold constructed sparks, and every spark placed into a pre-built frame should have, in a just world, gone through the same growth stages as any forged Cybertronian. 
- Cold construction is one of the oldest parts of Mirror Mirror, and has remained relatively unchanged compared to many other aspects of the universe. From the moment Mirror Mirror became an original continuity rather a Shattered Glass take on Generation One, I knew cold construction was going to be a part of it. 
- Cold construction is an extension of the militarism of pre-war Cybertron, and a direct product of its dystopic conditions. Unlike in IDW, where cold construct sparks are meaningfully different, in Mirror Mirror, they are essentially, forged Cybertronians who were robbed of not just their ability to find their true shape, but their very childhoods as a result of a paranoid and militaristic government that wanted to create the perfect war machine. “What if the United States government contracted Lockheed Martin to build people?” 
- No mechanical species is capable of sexual reproduction. It’s one of the key factors that determines whether a species is organic or mechanical. 
- The reason that sparklings exist in Mirror Mirror, aside from the fact that I like exploring what childhood looks like for aliens and I think the idea of Cybertronians having a larval stage is really funny, is to hammer home both the horrors of the Great War, and the exploitative nature of the pre-war government. Aside from the obvious “what if Lockheed Martin and Raytheon made people?” one of the most horrifying things about cold constructs is the way that they are deprived of a childhood in every sense— they aren’t only stuffed into an adult frame right away, they are literally denied the ability to explore themselves and find out who they are on their own. They have no family ties, they have nobody to guide them through life beyond the company that created them, or the military that paid for their existence. This is even worse for M.T.O.s, who aren’t even given any education beyond the ability to kill— they are newborns, and yet, they are denied the innocence of childhood before they even have the chance to grasp what it is they’re losing. Giving Cybertronians a childhood makes the idea of being put through boot camp or outright dropped into a battlefield within a few hours of waking up all the more visceral— the companies that defined the pre-war world and the conflict that defined the wartime one stole a whole chapter of their lives from them, because they wanted workers and soldiers that they didn’t have to wait for. Those forged during or before the war are akin to the Lost Generation, the tens of thousands of boys fresh out of high school who enlisted to fight in WWI. They’re thrown into war before they understand even themselves, and have their sense of the world so warped by conflict that once it ends, they find themselves lost in peacetime because they only ever learned to define themselves during and by the war that had been going on their whole adult life, if not their entire life.
- The growth cycle of sparklings is patterned off of insects! This is a leftover bit of old lore, where Primus patterned Cybertronians off of hive insects, but I decided to keep it even though I’ve changed the surrounding lore quite a bit.
