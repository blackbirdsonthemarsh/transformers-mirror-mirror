The process by which [[Cybertronians\|Cybertronians]] change shape. Cybertronian bodies are built around the process of transformation, and Cybertronian [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Reproduction\|development]] is considered to be finished when they transform for the first time. 

Cybertronians are not only capable of shifting from one (or [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Multi-changers\|many]]) forms to another. Some Cybertronians have [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Inbuilt Weaponry\|weapons built into their frames]] which can be hidden away via transformation. Others are capable of transforming their kibble (a term referring to the parts of a Cybertronian that only exist because of their alternate mode, and serve no purpose in their robot mode) into a more compact shape. Some Cybertronians are optimized for fast transformations, while others are optimized for a nearly kibble-free robot mode. 

Some Cybertronians, like [[Tracks\|Tracks]] and [[Characters/Prowl\|Prowl]], can switch between a standard vehicle, and a version of that vehicle capable of flight or aquatic travel. 
##### Notes

- There is no real equivalent to the t-cog in Mirror Mirror. The only way to prevent a transformation is to either rip out all of the parts needed for their alternate mode, or flat-out lobotomize them.
