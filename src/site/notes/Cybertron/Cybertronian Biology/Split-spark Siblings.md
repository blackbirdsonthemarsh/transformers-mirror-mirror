[[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Spark\|Spark]] naturally vary in power, and when [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Outlier\|outliers]] are excluded, they typically fall along a bell curve. However, it is possible for a newly-emerged spark to be too powerful to survive its own [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Reproduction\|ignition]].  If such sparks were to ignite, the resulting explosion would tear the spark apart, and likely take the surrounding sparks with it. Thus, these unstable sparks split, dividing their power as many times as it takes until they reach a safe level of power.

Some theorize that [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Outlier\|outliers]] are the result of a similar survival mechanism, where a spark does not split, but instead mutates into a new form capable of surviving. 

Notable split-spark siblings include:
- [[Characters/Megatron\|Megatron]] and [[Characters/Galvatron\|Galvatron]]
- [[Characters/Starscream\|Starscream]], [[Characters/Skywarp\|Skywarp]] and [[Characters/Thundercracker\|Thundercracker]]
- [[Characters/Optimus Prime\|Optimus Prime]] and [[Characters/Ultra Magnus\|Ultra Magnus]]
- [[Characters/Lyzack\|Lyzack]] and [[Leozack\|Leozack]]
- [[Characters/Rumble\|Rumble]] and [[Characters/Frenzy\|Frenzy]]
- [[Characters/Skyfire\|Skyfire]] and [[Jetfire\|Jetfire]] 
- [[Needlenose\|Needlenose]] and [[Tracks\|Tracks]] 
- [[Sideswipe\|Sideswipe]] and [[Sunstreaker\|Sunstreaker]]
##### Notes
---
- Mirror Mirrorâ€™s take on twins, triplets, etc. is largely inspired by their portrayal in the Prime cartoon. Ironically enough, the pair of twins that inspired this portrayal are not present in Mirror Mirror. Dreadwing does not exist in Mirror Mirror (though [[Characters/Dreadwind\|Dreadwind]] and [[Characters/Darkwing\|Darkwing]] do!) and Skyquake has no siblings. 
- The appearance of a [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Reproduction\|forged]] Cybertronian is not solely determined by the [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Spark\|genetic instructions coded within their spark]], meaning that bar [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Reproduction\|split sparks put into pre-fab bodies]], there are no identical twins.
