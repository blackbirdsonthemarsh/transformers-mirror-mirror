A [[Cybertron\|Cybertronian]] city-state nestled on the coast of the [[Cybertron/Locations/Mithril Sea\|Mithril Sea]]. Kalis is the largest seaport on Cybertron, and has been the heart of seaborne trade for millions of years. Due to the presence of sea monsters, the Kalisian harbor is heavily defended, enclosed by high walls studded with impressive gun batteries. Battleships and aircraft carriers have always patrolled its waters, to keep transport ships safe from the beasts that lurk below.

Monster hunting is something of a coming-of-age tradition in Kalis, and the body parts of such creatures are used in construction. Various government buildings around the city are built from the heads of monsters, with the entrance being through the mouth. Buildings in Kalis are painted in bright, eye-catching colors, with detailed patterns around their doorways.
