In days past, Nova Cronum was once a great military power — though it paled in comparison to the likes of [[Cybertron/Polities/Vos\|Vos]] and [[Cybertron/Polities/Polyhex\|Polyhex]] — [[Characters/Elita One\|many]] would say that Nova Cronum has become little more than a shell of its former self. The city was reduced to little more than rubble during the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Quintesson War\|Quintesson War]], and though it has long since rebuilt, the scars have yet to fade. 
##### Notes
---
- Characters built or forged in Nova Cronum include: [[Characters/Elita One\|Elita One]], [[Skids\|Skids]], [[Jhiaxus\|Jhiaxus]], [[Megajet\|Megajet]] and [[Characters/Rewind\|Rewind]]. 
- Instead of being hailed a city of thinkers and philosophers, Nova Cronum was once a second-rate military power whose citizens never quite got over that inferiority complex.
