A city-state in the northern half of [[Cybertron\|Cybertron]], high in the [[Cybertron/Locations/Tagan Heights\|Tagan Heights]]. Uraya has had a long and complicated relationship with its nearest neighbor, [[Altihex\|Altihex]], involving a nigh uncountable amount of wars, invasions and conquests. For as long as they’ve had a national identity, the two city-states have regarded each other as their oldest enemies— though now, that term is used quite affectionately, as fighting on [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Quintesson War\|the same side against invaders]] followed by millions of years of being part of [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Primacy\|the same nation]] has caused them to long-since abandon their rivalries. 

During the [[The Great War/Great War\|Great War]], the two city-states were officially neutral, but sympathetic to the [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticons]].
##### Notes
---
- Urayan and Altihexian are quite similar languages due to literally millions of years of cultural cross-pollination, while Tetrahexian sounds utterly alien to the both of them. Think of how Norwegian and Danish are similar enough, but, say, Finnish sounds nothing like either of them despite Finland being right next door geographically speaking.
