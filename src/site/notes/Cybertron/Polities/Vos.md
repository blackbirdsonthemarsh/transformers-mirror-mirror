One of the oldest [[Cybertron\|Cybertronian]] city-states.
##### Notes
--- 
- Vos is an amalgamation of not only the city-state’s various depictions throughout the franchise’s history, but Crystal City as well. This is a nod to Starscream’s backstory in the Shattered Glass series put out by Fun Publications. n 
- Vos, and [[Cybertron/Polities/Polyhex\|Polyhex]] being situated on floating islands is, in the context of Mirror Mirror, uncommon, but not unexpected. Floating islands are quite common on Cybertron, though few are large enough to build a city on, and even fewer have their own [[Hot Spot\|sparkfields]]. Some floating islands, like the [[Cybertron/Locations/Hydrax Plateau\|Hydrax Plateau]], are utterly massive. 
- Characters built or forged in Vos include: [[Characters/Starscream\|Starscream]], [[Characters/Skywarp\|Skywarp]], [[Characters/Thundercracker\|Thundercracker]], [[Sunstorm\|Sunstorm]], [[Characters/Bitstream\|Bitstream]], [[Hotlink\|Hotlink]], [[Nacelle\|Nacelle]], [[Slipstream\|Slipstream]], [[Characters/Lyzack\|Lyzack]], [[Leozack\|Leozack]], [[Acid Storm\|Acid Storm]], [[Ion Storm\|Ion Storm]], [[Nova Storm\|Nova Storm]], [[Dirge\|Dirge]], [[Ramjet\|Ramjet]], [[Thrust\|Thrust]], [[Characters/Flyhigh\|Flyhigh]], [[Characters/Triggerhappy\|Triggerhappy]], [[Slugslinger\|Slugslinger]] [[Characters/Red Wing\|Red Wing]], [[Sideswipe\|Sideswipe]], and [[Sunstreaker\|Sunstreaker]].
