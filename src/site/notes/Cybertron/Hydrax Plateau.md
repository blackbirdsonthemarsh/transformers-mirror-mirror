An island floating above the [[Cybertron/Sea of Rust\|Sea of Rust]], home to [[Cybertron\|Cybertron’s]] largest spaceport. The plateau was once an uninhabited island, but some time before the [[History, Society and Culture/Quintesson War\|Quintesson War]], it broke free from the surface of the planet and began to float. Its height keeps it far above the harsh weather of the sea below.

As part of his campaign of investing in Cybertron’s infrastructure in the wake of the Quintesson War, [[Characters/Nominus Prime\|Nominus Prime]] funded the construction of Cybertron’s largest spaceport. 

During the [[History, Society and Culture/Decepticon Uprising\|Decepticon Uprising]], the Hydrax Plateau and its spaceport was one of the first locations to be secured by the [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticons]], and they held it throughout the [[The Great War/Great War\|Great War]]. 
##### Notes

- Pieces of the planet detaching, rising into the air and becoming floating islands, or even archipelagos, is not at all uncommon. Many major cities are built atop them, with [[Polities of Cybertron/Vos\|Vos]] and [[Polities of Cybertron/Polyhex\|Polyhex]] being the most famous examples.
