A grisly punishment for so-called criminals, instated by the [[Senate\|Senate]]under the reign of [[Characters/Nominus Prime\|Nominus Prime]]. Victims would have their faces removed from their heads, replaced with a featureless screen, and have their hands replaced with claws. First, standard-issue empurata hands had three claws, but under the reign of [[Characters/Sentinel Prime\|Sentinel Prime]], it was decided that pincers were much faster and cheaper to produce than proper fingers with joints, and they became the new standard. 

The punishment was instated, supposedly, to mark those who were a danger to society, traitors to their very kind— to ensure they could simply move on from their crimes. Specifically, it was to be applied to those who sided with the invading [[Quintessons\|Quintessons]], turning against their people and bowing before their invaders. In the immediate wake of the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Quintesson War\|Quintesson War]], the idea of a permanent brand for such people was met with widespread support, with those who disagreed keeping their heads down. Of course, it did not remain simply for traitors and 

Empurata is not merely meant to mark the victim as a subject of ridicule and ostracization. It is meant to deny their personhood, by stripping them of their face — their very identity — and their hands, both of which are the first things on a forged Cybertronian to take their final shape. It is the very literal removal of the first things that made one identifiable.

Empurata also serves to deny victims the ability to properly participate in Cybertronian culture. Many Cybertronian languages have non-verbal components, whether through sign language or [chirolinguistics](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Chirolinguistics). The removal of fingers and face prevents one from being able to sign properly, and their new claws lack the sensors required for chirolinguistics. Empuratas cannot eat solid foods, and have to rely purely on their refueling ports— which have no taste receptors whatsoever.

- The reason empurata in Mirror Mirror involves the replacement of the face, rather than the head, is because the latter was deemed too expensive.
