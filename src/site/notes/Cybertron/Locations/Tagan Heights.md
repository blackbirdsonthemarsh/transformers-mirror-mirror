A geographic region in the northern half of [[Cybertron\|Cybertron]], at the edge of the [[Cybertron/Locations/Mithril Sea\|Mithril Sea]]. The region is defined by ancient mountain ranges, dissected plateaus and deep, cascading valleys. It’s said that the mountains in the region are the oldest on Cybertron, dating back to the days of the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Thirteen\|Thirteen]]. Local legends claim that the many rifts and valleys are scars left upon [[Cybertron/Primus\|Primus]] by his [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/Culture/Primus, Unicron and Gaea\|brother]]. 

Due to the rich mineral deposits in the region, many of its city-states historically had economies centered around [[Cybertron/Polities/Uraya\|mining]] and [[Cybertron/Polities/Praxus\|industry]], and the region was once responsible for over forty percent of Cybertron’s industrial output, though mismanagement under the [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Primacy\|interwar government]] lead to rapid deindustrialization in the region. While some [[Tetrahex\|cities]] managed to pivot away from industry before it collapsed in the region, some, like [[Cybertron/Polities/Praxus\|Praxus]], have struggled economically ever since, suffering from declining infrastructure, low employment, and high rates of emigration, [particularly of the well-educated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital_flight).  

The largest cities in the region are [[Cybertron/Polities/Praxus\|Praxus]], [[Altihex\|Altihex]], [[Tetrahex\|Tetrahex]], [[Cybertron/Polities/Uraya\|Uraya]] and [[Cybertron/Polities/Protihex\|Protihex]]. 
##### Notes
---
- While the geography of the Tagan Heights are modeled after various mountain ranges and plateaus on Earth, the history of the city-states within it — notably, [[Cybertron/Polities/Praxus\|Praxus]] — are modeled after a region of the United States known as the [Rust Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Belt).
