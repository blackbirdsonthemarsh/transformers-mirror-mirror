The Sonic Canyons are one of the strangest places on [[Cybertron\|Cybertron]], and are a stark reminder of the planet’s nature as a [[Cybertron/Primus\|living being]]. Cybertron is made up of layers and layers of metal, tens of miles apart, wrapped around the body of [[Primus.\|Primus.]] The edges of these plates align to form [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Transformation\|transformation seams]], leading to a series of cracks spiderwebbing along the planet, that lead straight down to the internals of Primus himself. Some of these cracks are hardly noticeable, something not even a human could fall through, while others are veritable chasms. 

The largest of these chasms are located in the southern hemisphere of Cybertron, and through them you can hear the nigh-deafening sound of the planet’s internals shifting, thousands of miles below the surface. The sound welling up from these canyons has given them their name. 

Despite their inhospitable environment, the canyons are surrounded by some of the most active [[Hot Spot\|hot spots]] on Cybertron, and the region has developed a thriving industry thanks to their unique access to a cross-section of the very planet. Perhaps the most famous city-state in the region is [[Cybertron/Polities/Kaon\|Kaon]], the beating heart of Cybertronian industry.

- The Sonic Canyons are, in effect, a straight shot down to Primus himself.
