A nigh-indestructible metal that occurs only on Cybertron, in the very deepest layers of the planet. Ununtrium has captivated the imagination of Cybertronians for as long as they’ve been aware of it. Ununtrium shares many properties with [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Living Metal\|living metal]], indicating a [[Cybertron/Primus\|connection]] between the materials. 

For an uncountable amount of years, Cybertronians have been trying to enhance themselves with ununtrium— and even create ‘bots comprised entirely of it. Early experiments with [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Reproduction\|forged]] ‘bots proved disastrous, as their sparks were unable to handle their new frames. Eventually it was accepted that the most that could be done was [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Inbuilt Weaponry\|incorporating]] ununtrium weapons into otherwise normal Cybertronian frames. 

Until the reign of [[Zeta Prime\|Zeta Prime]], where these experiments were quietly restarted. Previous experiments had been conducted on [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Reproduction\|forged]] Cybertronians, trying to rebuild their frames piece by piece, and Zeta’s scientists speculated that the slow, gradual changes made put an increasing amount of strain on the spark. Perhaps, they suggested, a spark would take far better to a ununtrium frame if it was all it had ever known. 

It was not until the twilight years of Zeta’s reign that these experiments bore fruit, when [[Cybertron/Polities/Vos\|Vosian]] military engineers created a set of three frames with ununtrium skeletons, and the rest of their components made from an alloy of ununtrium and living metal. These frames were built from the ground up to be the pinnacle of military technology, and representations of not just [[Cybertron/History, Society and Culture/History/Primacy\|Cybertronian]], but [[Cybertron/Polities/Vos\|Vosian]] military might. Everything about them, from their faces, to their voices, to even the color of their optics was carefully decided, to project the exact image their designers wanted. 

 Yet, the experiment seemed to be an abject failure. Each spark implanted in the frames failed to take to them, guttering out one after another— the only reason the experiments were allowed to continue past the limit where other frames would be scrapped was because of how much had been spent on it already. There were talks of shutting the program down, until [[Characters/Starscream\|three]] [[Characters/Skywarp\|outlier]] [[Characters/Thundercracker\|sparks]] emerged in the Vosian [[Hot Spot\|sparkfields]]. When it was discovered that these sparks were [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Split-spark Siblings\|triplets]], those behind the project hoped that the [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Outlier\|output power]] of the sparks, combined with their bond, would keep them stable long enough that they would take to their new bodies. 

Through studies conducted on these ‘bots, it was discovered that ununtrium functioned almost *exactly* like living metal. Self-repair worked flawlessly, producing ununtrium to heal any injuries, metal consumed would be converted not to living metal, but ununtrium. If not for the fac tthat they were nearly indestructible, they would be indistinguishable from any other Cybertronian. 

Through later research, ironically conducted by [[Characters/Starscream\|Starscream]] himself, it was determined that the method of construction had nothing to do with whether a spark would take or not. It was the nature of the spark that determined everything— just as only a Cybertronian [[Cybertron/Cybertronian Biology/Spark\|spark]] was capable of handling most living metal, only outliers were capable of handling ununtrium. This discovery would, come the [[The Great War/Great War\|Great War]], lead to the creation of the [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Warriors Elite\|Warriors Elite]], under Starscream’s auspices. Where Starscream and his brothers only had pure ununtrium in their internals, the Warriors Elite were rebuilt from the ground up — piece by piece, over months — out of ununtrium, down to the last joint. The process was excruciatingly difficult, and required absolute precision every step of the way. 

Their creation changed the playing field entirely, tilting the war in the [[The Great War/Factions/Decepticons/Decepticon\|Decepticons’]] favor. The [[The Great War/Factions/Autobots/Autobot\|Autobots]] were desperate to replicate the process, and expended a great deal of money, time, and manpower trying, but they never managed to learn the secret behind their creation. 
##### Notes
---
- Most living metal is, in effect, the flesh and skin of [[Primus.\|Primus.]] Ununtrium is his skeleton. Ununtrium is Cthulhu’s bones. 
- Instead of ununtrium being an incredibly rare element, it’s quite common, but nigh impossible to work with. 
- Instead of Starscream, Skywarp and Thundercracker being three of many nigh-identical Seekers in G1, or Starscream being created to be a disposable nobody in IDW, their Mirror Mirror incarnations were built to be special, and this is played for horror.
