[[Cybertronian Biology/Sparks\|Sparks]] naturally vary in power, and when [[Cybertronian Biology/Outliers\|outliers]] are excluded, they typically fall along a bell curve. However, it is possible for a newly-emerged spark to be too powerful to survive its own [[Cybertronian Biology/Sparklings\|ignition]].  If such sparks were to ignite, the resulting explosion would tear the spark apart, and likely take the surrounding sparks with it. Thus, these unstable sparks split, dividing their power as many times as it takes until they reach a safe level of power.

Some theorize that the existence of [[Cybertronian Biology/Outliers\|outliers]] is the result of a similar survival mechanism, where a spark does not split, but instead mutates into a new form capable of surviving. 

Notable split-spark siblings include:
- [[Characters/Megatron\|Megatron]] and [[Characters/Galvatron\|Galvatron]]
- [[Characters/Starscream\|Starscream]], [[Characters/Skywarp\|Skywarp]] and [[Characters/Thundercracker\|Thundercracker]]
- [[Characters/Optimus Prime\|Optimus Prime]] and [[Characters/Ultra Magnus\|Ultra Magnus]]
- [[Characters/Lyzack\|Lyzack]] and [[Leozack\|Leozack]]
